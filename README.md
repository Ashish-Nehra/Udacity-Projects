## Finding Donors
In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms of my choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized this algorithm to best model the data. My goal with that implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicted whether an individual made more than $50,000. This sort of task could arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survived on donations. Understanding an individual's income could help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it could be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, I could (as I saw) infer this value from other publicly available features.

## Flower Image Classification
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize various species of flowers. I could imagine utilizing such a classifier in a phone application that would identify the name of the flower captured by the camera. In practice, I trained the classifier and can use it for integration into my application.

## Identify Custoer Segments
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that formed the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments were intended to be utilized for directing marketing campaigns towards audiences with the highest expected rate of returns. The data used for the analysis was provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and represented a real-life data science task.
